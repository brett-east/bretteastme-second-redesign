							<p class="lead">Front End Web Developer <span class="small">full-time</span></p>
							<p>I began working for the startup <a href="http://weddingtonway.com">Weddington Way</a> at the start of February 2016, in a Front End Web Developer capacity. Since joining the team, my role has expanded to include assessing the user experience of various ‘paths’ on the site. Most recently, I assessed the mobile checkout flow and reported a number of issues with user understanding, UI, and bugs/poor user experiences. After writing assessments of user experience problems, I work with the product manager to create bugs/feature requests for myself of the full-stack engineers to work on.</p>
							<p>I work as a bridge between the web/graphic designers in the team, and the backend focused, full stack engineers to ensure that behaviour and interaction are not lost between design and development. I code at the front end, in HTML, SASS and Javascript to ensure that our UIs provide a seamless experience and expected behaviour to our users.</p>
							<p>I work with the full stack engineers when needing to implement a design using more in depth components of Ruby on Rails, and work with the designers to ensure their layouts and mockups are considered and appropriate for the context of the user.</p>

							<p class="lead">UI/UX Designer and Developer <span class="small">contract</span></p>
							<p>I joined a large team of over 18 Business Analysts, Testers and Developers as the only UI and UX designer and developer to work on the redesign of the jobs.gov.au website. The site is still undergoing a redesign, and I unfortunately was only able to work on the project for two months. However, in that time, I began as the Lead UI/UX designer and developer for the project, wearing many hats and working with six different teams each made up of a business analyst, a backend engineer and a tester. My role was to work with the business analysts in designing a front-end solution to their problems or business needs, and then working with the engineers to put them in place.</p>
							<p>Primarily I would design and build a part of the site’s UI, based on user and business needs, in HTML, Less and Javascript and then hand that over to the engineers to use in the site. Often my code would only needed access to databases and the backend, and could then be used without changes on the site.</p>

							<p>I was brought on board to CASA to continue with the creation and updating of web accessible PDFs and smart forms using the Adobe javascript API. I began by troubleshooting and fixing existing bugs in the forms and continued with creating new forms and updating older ones. My role later expanded into the creation of workflows and processes for the customer service team to use with the new software being implemented as part of the larger project I was part of. I also became part of the team providing training on how to use the software.</p>

							<p>My primary role was to design User Interfaces for Agency stakeholders. In this role I met with stakeholders and other project staff to determine the best workflow for users and primary goals of the web application. I worked on three applications targeted at various policing audiences and one for public use. During the design of these applications I employed best web standards and practices in determining layout, flow, the display of content and web accessibility of the interfaces. I also used research, reports and in-house usability testing to support my decisions or to further develop the interfaces.</p>
