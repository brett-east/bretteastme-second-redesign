						<h1 class="text-center">What is a UX Engineer?</h1>
						<section>
							<p>A little while ago I read a <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3032719/ui-ux-who-does-what-a-designers-guide-to-the-tech-industry">great article, from fastcodesign</a>, on the differences between UX Designers, Interaction Designers, UI Designers and more.</p>

              <p>However they didn't quite touch on the role of UX Engineer, a position that I've seen advertised for more and more, of late. The Google offices in Mountain View were looking to fill a few roles with this title just a few weeks ago. So, given I currently class myself as a UX Engineer, I thought I would elaborate on how I see that fitting in with the ever evolving UI/UX landscape.</p>

              <p>A UX Engineer, is essentially a Front End Web Developer that focuses on user experience. Often I will be presented with a problem or a solution from a business analyst and then mockup a web component (say a carousel, or nav, or timer etc) in working code and refine it, essentially to the point where it usable on a website, and then hand it off to Backend Engineers so that they can add their database hooks and implement it into the site.</p>

              <p>I would say it is definitely one of those broader roles, where an employer is trying to get a 'UX Designer' and a 'Front End Engineer' in the one position. The benefit of finding someone that can fill this position, is that you have a person that can take a usable and thought through solution from design right through to workable component.</p>

              <p>Another way to look at it would be as a UX Designer with technical capabilities. Someone who can not only come up with a great UX concept, but also develop the component with working front end code. I say 'front end' code as this role does primarily focus on the front end still, so rather than build something that pulls in information from a database, a UX Engineer might build something that works with dummy data and hand it off to a Back End Engineer. This is not always the case, but it is more common for a UX Engineer to not spread quite so far through the development stack and focus more on the front end, particularly as that is where the user experience sits.</p>

              <p><strong>Extra:</strong> Given this role is a broad brush stroke across UX and development, job descriptions will often also include elements of a UI Designer and will often require a user interface design element as well. While UI and UX roles can be completely independent of each other (as in different positions), it often helps to have a knowledge of the other one, especially as many small to mid-sized companies can't often afford to put money into both roles.</p>

              <p>To help paint a picture of a UX Engineer, here are some roles & responsibilities and skills/qualifications taken from actual advertised UX Engineer roles:</p>

              <p>Roles and Responsibilities:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Work closely with UX designers, project managers and back-end engineers to implement versatile front-end solutions.</li>
                <li>Provide front-end coding and design expertise, and be ready to present design ideas to engineers, product management and other teams.</li>
                <li>Make our products better for our users, advocate for them, always seeking ways to improve and innovate</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Skills and qualifications:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>BA/BS degree in Computer Science or Design (e.g., interaction, graphic, visual communications, product, industrial), HCI, CS or a related field.</li>
                <li>Strong knowledge of web standards including HTML5, CSS3</li>
                <li>Strong JavaScript skills</li>
                <li>Strong, clean visual design sense.</li>
                <li>Good interaction design skills.</li>
                <li>Familiarity with CSS processing languages such as Less/Sass</li>
                <li>Familiarity with JS frameworks such as Angular</li>
                <li>Familiarity with prototyping and design tools such as Axure, Photoshop, Illustrator</li>
              </ul>
              <br/>
              <p class="lead">For me this is an exciting role where you get to make decisions and produce designs to help the user but also bring them into implementation.</p>
