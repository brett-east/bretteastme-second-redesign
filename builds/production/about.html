I usually contract for Australian Government agencies, but I'm currently taking some time between contracts to apply for jobs in the USA.</p><p>I graduated from the University of Canberra with a Bachelor of Arts and three majors - Graphic Design, Digital Media, and Media Arts and Production. I love good design and have a bit of an entrepreneurial streak; I've had both successful and unsuccessful ventures in media, crowdfunding, cosmetic sales, subscription boxes and probably a number of other domains.</p><p>If you want to know about my professional experience and background, check out my resume page, otherwise for a bit of story, stick around here.</p><hr><h2>The longer version</h2><p><span class=lead>When I was in high school my dad told me I should do something with computers as a career</span> - but I'll get back to this point later.</p><p>I grew up in a regional town in Australia, and after taking a year off before college (I worked in a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_rental_shop target=_blank data-toggle=tooltip title="A link, in case you've forgotten what a video store is.">video store</a>) I went to the Nation's capital, Canberra, to study a double degree in Law and Sports Journalism.</p><p>It took me a year of studying (and not so much studying) to work out that this wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, and that my ambition reached beyond a newspaper desk or a courtroom.</p><p>Now I faced the paradox of choice, do I study business, or science, or engineering - in the end I did the smart thing and based my decision on what my friends were doing :/ I had a mate who threw in studying Economics for Graphic Design, and I thought I'd join him. So a Bachelor of Graphic Design it was - at least for a couple of years anyway. As a young guy, I was still working on finding that balance of what interested me and what I felt I could do for the rest of my life. I found that I preferred a few of my design subjects over others, things like 3D animation and film making, so when I found out that these subjects and other constituted their own degree, I changed again.</p><p>Now I had been at university for 3 years, and thanks to the changes, still had 3 years to go. By year 5, I was growing tired of study and school, I was also working full-time at the university organising student events (I had been the president of a few clubs and societies, and had now found a way to get paid for the work), so I embarked on my final change. I sat down and looked at my transcript, thinking that surely after 5 years of study I had completed enough subjects to just graduate with something and get on with my life. Turns out I was right.</p><p>Five years of study had supplied me with enough knowledge to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts with majors in Graphic Design, Digital Media, and Media Arts and Production. So I packed up my school bag and my full time job and got out of there.</p><p>It was after graduating I picked up my first job, a coolish government gig working on building web applications for state and federal police agencies. I began as a graphic and web designer and this role eventually evolved into a web UI designer and developer.</p><p>Government work is okay, and it turns out that it supplies you with quite a lot of free time outside of work hours, and it was then that I started my first entrepreneurial venture, an entry into the crowdfunding market. Things didn't work out and after months and months of work and enough money to put down a home deposit, I threw in the towel - it's important to know when to do this! I learnt a lot of valuable lessons in this time, and have since pursued a number of other ventures, some more successful than others.</p><p>In 2014, I left that government job and took some time to head over to the USA - I spent about 2.5 months working as a sailing instructor at a summer camp, and about 2.5 months travelling the country. When I came back to Australia, things fell into place a little more and I knew I wanted to be a web designer and developer, I had a real passion for great user interfaces and the coding that held them together. I picked up a six month contract working as a pdf smartforms and javascript developer and then spent another 5 months abroad in the USA.</p><p>Which brings me to today.</p><p>I'm currently chasing my dream of working as a web developer in the USA (if you think you can help, <a href=contact.html>feel free to drop me a line</a>). Unfortunately, working within government doesn't give me a lot of options when it comes to showing off the work I've done, as a lot of it falls within security classifications. So my new challenge is to build my online presence with things that I can share, while also applying for jobs in the States.</p><p>Oh and that bit about dad telling me to do something with computers for a career, well I guess the moral of that story is that no matter how right your dad is, sometimes you spend 10yrs trying to work out what he told you from the beginning - he likes to remind me of this fact!</p></section></div></div></div></div><main-footer></main-footer><script src=https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js></script><script>
